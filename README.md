# wordle_helper
This is a very simple python script that helps you solve the daily Wordle.

It consists of the wordle.txt file that contains an extended list of possible 5 letter words. This file needs to be located in the same directory as the wordle_helper.py script.

The wordle_helper.py script essentially helps narrow the list of possible word choices to guess from based on which letters are excluded or included. 

Time permitting, I may go back and add features that would suggest your next guess based on what has already been entered and which words are available.
